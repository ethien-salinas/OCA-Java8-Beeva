Exercise 13-1

1. Convert the days array to an ArrayList.
     Use Arrays.asList to return a List.  
     Use that List to initialize a new ArrayList.  
     Preferably do this all on one line.
2. Iterate through the ArrayList, testing to see if an element is "sunday".
     If it is a "sunday" element, print it out, converting it to upper case.
     Use:
       (from the String class)
         - public boolean equals (Object o);
         - public void toUpperCase();
 
     If it is not "sunday", print it out anyway, but not in upper case.

3. After the for loop print out the ArrayList.
     While within the loop, did "sunday" get printed in upper case?
     Was the "sunday" element in the array converted to upper case?
     Your instructor will explain what's going on in the next topic.
