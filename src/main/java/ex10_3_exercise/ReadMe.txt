Exercise 10-3

In the Order class:
1. Rewrite the calcDiscount code using a switch statement.  
     Use a ternary expression to replace the nested if logic.
     For better performance, use a break statement in each case block.
     Include a default block to handle invalid custType values.

2. Run the ShoppingCart class again to test your logic.
