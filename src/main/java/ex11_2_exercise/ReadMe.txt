Exercise 11-2

1. Parse the args array to populate name and age.  
     If the args array contains fewer than 2 elements, print
       a message, telling the user that 2 arguments are required.
     Remember that the age argument will have to be 
       converted to an int. 
       Hint: Use a static method of Integer class to convert it.

2. Print the name and age values with a suitable label.
