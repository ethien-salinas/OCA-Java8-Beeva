Exercise 10-1

In the TestClass:
1. Use a ternary operator to perform the same logic as
     shown in the if | else construct.  
2. Print the result of the ternary operator.
     (Keep in mind, that the if statement changes the value
     of x, so the output of the second print statement will
     be different than the first.)
